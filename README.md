### Problem Statement:
*The Problem:*

The current system for documenting the condition of rooms is redundant, ambiguous and tedious. More specifically, students use an RCI (Room Condition Inventory) to document the state of the room when they move in and move out. The RCI is a long double-sided sheet of paper with space to comment on the state of various pieces of furniture in the room.   
As a paper-based system, it has become hard to manage for the hundreds of students who live on campus.
The current RCI system is redundant because a new RCI is required from each resident every year; information from previous years is not used.   
It is ambiguous because the descriptions are subjective. What one student sees as major damage might be seen by another as minor. Accurately describing the extent of the damage also gets tricky. It is common during move-out procedures for students to protest fines for damages by saying "It was there before!".  
It is tedious because a lot of manual work has to be put in by Residence Life to make sure information gets gathered.


*Vision:*

Our goal is to create a new RCI system that would be of benefit to students, Resident Advisors and Resident Directors. What we have in mind is a web-based system with a well thought out user interface that solves the problems presented above while also simplifying the process of recording the damages in a given room.  
As further ( but important ) enhancements, the system will also provide an administrative interface for RAs and RDs. The interface will assist Residence Life staff in doing manual tasks ( e.g. finding who hasn’t submitted RCI’s and compiling fines ).


## Testing
